An error happened in which a very old build got merged into the latest version, resulting in a very cluttered file structure of unused data! Due to time constraints I will likely not be able to clean this up, but the program is still fully functional (There are no conflicts with the extra data)

This document contains the TGP coursework of Miomu Green and Takudzwa Ash Maoko, worked on colaberatively by both, Certain elements of this repo contain merged branches that were produced outside of an online environment, and may not be clearly reflected in the staging of the repo.
